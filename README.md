# bio-rag-assistant
Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for exploring scientific publications on gene expression activation via microRNA, with future extensions for automated literature retrieval and bioinformatics analysis.

# Sample questions
For demo purposes copy-paste these sample questions:
- By what mechanism is gene activation carried out through microRNA?
- Which proteins are involved in the activation?
- Does gene expression activation via microRNA have therapeutic applications?
